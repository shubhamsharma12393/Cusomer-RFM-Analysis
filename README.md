What is RFM (recency, frequency, monetary) analysis?

RFM analysis is a marketing technique used to quantitatively rank and group customers based on the recency, frequency and monetary total of their recent transactions to identify the best customers and perform targeted marketing campaigns. The system assigns each customer numerical scores based on these factors to provide an objective analysis. RFM analysis is based on the marketing adage that "80% of your business comes from 20% of your customers."
RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis is a proven marketing model for behavior based customer segmentation. It groups customers based on their transaction history – how recently, how often and how much did they buy. RFM helps divide customers into various categories or clusters to identify customers who are more likely to respond to promotions and also for future personalization services.

RFM analysis ranks each customer on the following factors:

    Recency. How recent was the customer's last purchase? Customers who recently made a purchase will still have the product on their mind and are more likely to purchase or use the product again. Businesses often measure recency in days. But, depending on the product, they may measure it in years, weeks or even hours.
    Frequency. How often did this customer make a purchase in a given period? Customers who purchased once are often are more likely to purchase again. Additionally, first time customers may be good targets for follow-up advertising to convert them into more frequent customers.
    Monetary. How much money did the customer spend in a given period? Customers who spend a lot of money are more likely to spend money in the future and have a high value to a business.




Why it matters?

Given that you have stored this information into your database (i.e. CRM system), you can then divide your customers into various categories or clusters to identify those who are more likely to respond to specific offers/campaigns as well as for future personalization services. Common practice when it comes to segmentation is to think that ‘big spenders’ are the most valuable clients. But what if they purchased only once or a very long time ago? Do they still use our product? It makes sense to reward all of our clients that keep buying our services/products on a regular basis, spending as much money as possible. Are you able to track that? The answer is positive.

Limitations of RFM analysis

Using RFM modeling can provide valuable insights about customers. But it does not take into account many other factors about the customer.

In-depth targeted marketing may also use type of item purchased or customer campaign responses as factors. Customer demographics such as age, sex and ethnicity are not covered in RFM analysis either.

Additionally, RFM only uses historical data about customers and may not predict future customer activity. Predictive methods may be able to identify future customer behavior that RFM analysis cannot.
